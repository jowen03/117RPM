		QUESTION

<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a">
We implemented an rpcgenerate program that works for simple cases: ints, floats, strings, characters. Try out our submission with arithmetic.idl and floatarithmetic.idl
</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li>__X__ Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
...your answer here...
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
We got help from Noah Mendelsohn in creating a timeline to finish the project after the due date and prioritize goals.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
I am really grateful we took the extra time to get rpcgenerate working for simple cases. We both felt we learned a great deal about generalizability of code and it was super
exciting to play around with that. One instance of this we spent a good deal of time thinking about was how to generalize the python builder to work for functions that
had any number of arguments. In arithmetic.idl, all functions had two arguments. However, we chose to future-proof by generalizing our stub builder so that space for arguments
would be dynamically allocated for each function of the idl. In doing so, the resulting code was very ugly; argument variables that were allocated inside each conditional body
for each function of the idl. We had a conversation about the fact that we were literally programming something that would dynamically create a program, but in doing so it seems
there's a recurring theme of sacrificing brevity / modularity. Does this matter if it's a program made for machines by machines? I think the added power of having dynamic
numbers of functions, arguments, etc. in the idl is worth the tradeoff of redundant code. But it was interesting to think about that.

Honestly, I could just be biased because we did not complete it, but I don't know if it would have added too much knowledge had we expanded this to work for more complicated cases
such as structs or arrays. I worry it would have been more tedious than it would have added to our learning. That being said, we didn't do it, so I don't know what I don't know, lol :)
